# Sergei Perepelkin

I’m a software engineer in the mornings and a comic artist and a storyteller at nights. I eat ramen in Utrecht, obsessively take notes, and cry a little while watching cartoons.

<!-- ## Logs

The sequence of choices and concequences.

#### May 2024

- **Comics**. For a week I was sprinting by drawing one-page comic strip per day. I was waking up one hour early to make a sketch, which was then converted into complete page the same evening. At the end of the week stories stoped coming. It was fun while it lasted.
- **Birthday cards**. Dancing mouse and dicso cat. -->
